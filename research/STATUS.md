# K4/K5 investigation

## Current application checkpoint M — 2026-10-13

All nine improvements explicitly requested after checkpoint L are implemented: persistent CPU/CUDA workers, verified optimizer seeds, joint factor bounds, certified GPU ranking, durable recipe campaigns with exact family reuse, reduced-clue recovery, competing-model controls, adaptive resource controls, and safe import with letter tracing. The app is version 0.2.0. [Checkpoint M](IMPROVEMENTS_M.md) maps each improvement to implementation and acceptance evidence.

Recursive integration review also fixed result-commit failure handling, campaign dispatch recovery, resource-event accounting, alias diagnostics, Windows worker-descendant ownership, idempotent cleanup, elapsed-time precision and mobile table overflow. The clean publication copy ran 310 tests: 309 passed and one optional raw-source audit skipped. Actual CUDA tests and 42 browser assertions passed. The final persistent audit evaluated 20 pages of 256 candidates in each of four CPU/CUDA and one-shot/persistent modes, with identical rankings and 240 independent retained score/replay checks. The separate final search-quality audit covers CUDA seeding, all 81 partial joint-bound assignments and the declared holdout/positive/null controls. Evidence, source hashes and delivery status are in [release validation](release-validation.json).

This completes the explicitly requested implementation backlog after the recorded review; it is not a claim that no future improvement exists. K4/K5 decipherment remains unresolved. Exact rankings and exclusions apply only to the declared models, masks and evaluated coverage. No authenticated public K5 ciphertext is bundled. The old decision to defer exact-family deduplication is superseded by the implemented campaign workflow and its verified reuse case.

## Historical application checkpoint L — 2026-10-13

The user's active delivery goal is now a local CPU/GPU browser application and GitHub publication, with an evidence-driven improvement loop. The earlier choice to stop dashboard development is superseded. The cryptanalytic goal remains unresolved: this project has no authenticated K4 or K5 decipherment and bundles no authenticated public K5 ciphertext.

The local app provides bounded CPU/CUDA family scans, exact CPU constraint commands, persistent start/pause/stop/resume, candidate technique and replay evidence, exact large-count serialization, source/model identity checks and exclusive saved-state ownership. New correlated affine bounds reduce integrated bound evaluations from55 to30 on one fixed52-point control, preserving the optimum; no general speedup is claimed. Retained scan candidates also report sensitivity to letters forced indirectly by the model. Packaged sculpture geometry validates its pinned normalized data without requiring redistributed raw source pages; strict source auditing remains available separately.

The curated publication checkout runs256 tests:255 pass and one optional raw-source audit skips because its excluded source pages are unavailable. Explicit actual-CUDA tests pass on the NVIDIA RTX2060. Two canonical evidence records in `research/runs/release-L-002/` validate against the packaged execution inputs: synthetic CPU/CUDA pages test6,201 candidates per backend and60 independent retained score/replay checks; the correlated-bound audit checks all81 partial assignments of its52-point family. See [release validation](release-validation.json), [the local application guide](../docs/LOCAL_APP.md) and [the improvement ledger](improvement-state.json) for delivery status, browser/package validation and remaining limitations. The preceding L-001 evidence describes the version before the final transactional-control save fix.

Historical sections below preserve their original scope and contemporaneous state. Historical manifests refer to their original source revisions and optional local source caches; they are not assertions that the current checkout has those old hashes or redistributes every input.

## Historical checkpoint K

The goal remains a defensible decipherment, with an explicit method, full ciphertext reproduction, and independent verification. It has **not been achieved**. Matching the 24 released letters or producing plausible English is insufficient.

The user chose chat investigation with supporting code over a standalone application. Dashboard development is stopped. **Current checkpoint: K4-20261013-K.** [Latest findings](IMPROVEMENTS_K.md) and [new CLI examples](../docs/CLI_CHECKPOINT_K.md) supersede earlier testing restrictions and next-step lists below, which remain as historical records.

All seven post-J improvements are implemented: joint column/key recovery, shared keys/offsets, composable known alphabets, coordinate phase schedules, supported-edge pruning, crib-compatible hard controls, and lazy/adaptive/resumable CPU searches. Further improvements include exact marginal domains, cancellation diagnostics, factorial/free-key shortcuts, duplicate-factor merging, bounded frontiers, checkpoint integrity checks, consistent worker paths, per-job algebra-budget results and independent expanded-stage replay.

The frozen package passes216 unit tests, eight command executions and19 candidate replays. [Eight evidence manifests validate](checkpoint-K-validation.json). The harder five-language control run re-encrypts175,760 complete candidates: five real texts rank uniquely first, and all five nulls have17,576 valid alternatives. This tests one supplied cipher family and is not a real-world false-positive probability. New K4 banks yield38 complete exclusions and six unresolved records, with no witness: two width10/period3 joint cases hit the state cap, and four separate-outer-key mixed cases hit the relation-check cap. K4/K5 decipherment remains unresolved.

The user explicitly confirms n5_runner is inactive and will remain inactive during this improvement work. No further checks or interruption are needed on that basis. CPU tests are finished; no GPU worker, persistent search, dashboard server or external submission was started. Canonical ciphertext/crib data remain unchanged. Historical checkpoint-J entry-point and documentation snapshots are retained; earlier results refer to their original source revisions.

## Previous checkpoint J

All six checkpoint-I improvement tasks are implemented: unknown column order, general cipher layering, cached exact factor optimization, unknown cyclic alphabets, verified ordinal sculpture geometry, and broader independent-document evaluation. Additional improvements include matching propagation, exact ambiguity shortcuts, contradiction certificates, honest interrupted-search bounds, and16-stage candidate replay. [Seven canonical evidence records](checkpoint-J-validation.json) validate;164 unit tests and six new CLI examples pass. PK2 recovers uniquely; the generalized PK3 family matches all17,576 earlier candidates. The specified24 unknown-alphabet and8 three-substitution/two-route K4 records all reject. These bounded exclusions do not establish K4's method.

After returning home, the user explicitly authorized CPU/GPU testing. Before substantial testing, `wsl.exe --list --running --quiet` succeeded with empty output, and process/window checks exposed no Ubuntu runner. No running WSL distribution or `n5_runner` window was available to interrupt with Ctrl+C. Bounded CPU tests proceeded; no GPU workload or persistent background search was started. Each root cipher result explains its technique, assumptions, search, recovered values and verification; complete candidates include replayable stages. There is no K4/K5 solution or authenticated K5 input. The following sections preserve earlier checkpoints and their contemporaneous bounds.

## Base checkpoint K4-20261012-A

New project, no Git revision or research ledger exists. The initial source file `kryptos/data.py` had SHA-256 `de88a22162b54355b51aa86bc08f23d47f2c66d935835f9718a8c5b59ba95ad3`. This identifies the common input revision for delegated work; later source updates must preserve or explicitly revise the ciphertext and crib values. Code/output hashes are recorded separately by the bounded computation runner.

## Routes

1. **Exact cipher constraints.** Owner: root; independent fixed/periodic substitution check: interface agent. Test letter inventories and periodic keystream consistency before any language search. Pure transposition, fixed substitution, repeating modular keys, progressive modular keys, and plaintext/ciphertext feedback are separate scoped hypotheses. A conflict excludes only its stated model.
2. **Historically motivated layers.** Owner: root/engine agent. Preserve executable cipher primitives. Still unresolved: which substitution alphabets, ordering, and transformation stages the artist used. A known crib is a constraint on final plaintext and does not establish absence of intermediate transposition. Large searches deferred until `n5_runner` interruption is confirmed and a discriminating hypothesis is specified.
3. **Public source and verification evidence.** Owner: sources agent. Verify 2026 owner/verification developments and distinguish K5 as an attested further riddle from an available input. Read-only review; no external solution submission. K5 decipherment awaits authenticated material or a justified extraction from the sculpture.

Supporting code and sources are investigative artifacts, not a completed application. The next checkpoint must state actual exclusions, surviving assumptions, and what changes the next decision.

## Checkpoints B and C: completed exact computations

- [B results](runs/exact-001/results.json), [B manifest](runs/exact-001/manifest.json): 97-letter input; 24 crib positions. Pure transposition fails E inventory (2 ciphertext versus at least3 plaintext). All four pairs of standard/KRYPTOS plaintext/ciphertext alphabets, and all three modular equations, exclude repeating periods1..26. Minimum noncontradicted period27. Full plaintext feedback also first permits lag27 under its stated numeric-encoding convention; direct adjacent-crib checks alone were insufficient. No stochastic or language search was used.
- [Independent results](independent_checks.json), [manifest](independent_checks.manifest.json): arbitrary fixed substitution fails at Q26/Q27 versus N26/O27. Periodic arbitrary bijections have a different constraint family; period8 already fits the 24 letters and is not thereby a solution. Exact pair/divisor witnesses, a separate phase dictionary method, and completed alphabet permutations agree.
- [C results](runs/physical-001/results.json), [C manifest](runs/physical-001/manifest.json): 27 distinct physical-grid gather permutations, four alphabet pairs, three equations, periods1..26 =8,424 parameter combinations. Fifteen are crib-consistent, all period26. Some are algebraically equivalent. A separate agent rebuilt all permutations and rechecked every stored witness. No decipherment follows from these fits.

Both runner-generated manifests passed validation against current input/output hashes. B completed in about0.54seconds. These exclusions are not claimed to be novel.

## User refinement: two substitutions plus K3-style transposition

The user proposed layering K1's, K2's, and K3's methods with different keys. This is now the priority route. The earlier single-key checks do **not** rule it out. Adjacent additive substitutions on the same alphabet yield a key whose period divides the least common multiple of their periods, not necessarily either period. A transposition between them changes which key positions meet and generally destroys that simple periodicity.

CheckpointD tests all three placements of one specified transposition with two independent repeating keys, using exact bipartite constraints modulo26. The first route set remains an explicit physical-layout surrogate. The actual K3 transform and a justified adaptation from336 to97letters are being source-checked separately. Changing the alphabet between layers, padding, and alternate transposition keys remain distinct untested hypotheses.

The source review now includes the user's Wikipedia link and the current archive owner's June2026 statement. The owner says a separate97-character K5 ciphertext is intended for future release. No authenticated public copy or offline plaintext digest was located. K5 remains an open dependent route, not disproven.

## Checkpoints D and E: layered hypothesis, finite results

[D results](runs/layers-001/results.json), [D manifest](runs/layers-001/manifest.json), [E fit inspection](runs/fits-001/results.json), and [E manifest](runs/fits-001/manifest.json) preserve the bounded computations. The user-supplied [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) was read; [source and convention notes](../docs/LAYER_SOURCES.md) distinguish actual known-answer checks from K4 adaptations.

The reference K3 procedure reproduced every one of its336 letters and its inverse reproduced the ciphertext. Its explicitly chosen ragged, skip-empty adaptation at97 gave two distinct permutations after deduplication. Together with27 physical-layout scans, this made29 routes. Both substitutions used the same fixed KRYPTOS alphabet, arbitrary keys of lengths1..16, and all three placements of the transposition. This accounts for22,272 parameter combinations, including algebraically equivalent ones; it is not a count of independently distinct cipher systems.

- 21,254 combinations have exact modular-cycle contradictions.
- 1,018 combinations fit the24 known plaintext positions; every graph representative was checked by literal stage-by-stage re-encryption.
- All174 combinations using period pairs(10,8) or(8,10), across the29 routes and3 placements, contradict the cribs. This includes arbitrary different keys of those lengths, not just PALIMPSEST and ABSCISSA. It does **not** cover another alphabet, another transposition, nulls, or row-dependent key phases.
- Of the1,018 fits,986 have no independent cycle constraint: they could fit any values at these24 positions. This is over-flexibility, not positive evidence for the hypothesis. Another31 have one cycle constraint and one has two. Parameter selection and repeated testing preclude interpreting these counts as probabilities.
- Eight connected K3-adapted model records determine the complete plaintext up to a key gauge which cancels from the plaintext. Their exact strings are preserved inE. None reads as coherent English outside the forced clues. That is a language assessment, not a formal theorem about the intended plaintext.

The graph solver passed15 independent hand examples, including a non-involutive permutation which catches indexing/direction mistakes. The D run took about5.54seconds in one Python process. D/E manifests passed validation. An independent audit in [layer_audit.json](layer_audit.json) rederived all21,254 rejection certificates directly from the source ciphertext, key phases, and crib letters, and separately used Gaussian elimination over the prime fields modulo2 and13 for positive checks. It also recomputed all1,018 component counts. Neither app tests nor a large CPU/GPU search ran.

### Remaining implication and next handoff

The broad user hypothesis remains open: no source establishes the actual K4 layer order, transposition key, alphabet key, or incomplete-grid convention. The completed computations cover only the explicitly pinned versions, and the positive fits provide no convincing decryption.

Continue by testing a **specified change** to an obstructed model: independently keyed alphabets between substitutions, a source-motivated transposition family, or a justified null/padding convention. Do not simply rerun the same shared-alphabet8/10 models. A useful next small computation would propagate exact constraints with different alphabets in the two substitution stages and compare their predictive constraints with a control input; keep it separate from language ranking. Keyword or larger transposition searches remain deferred until `n5_runner` is confirmed interrupted. K5's next step depends on authenticated public ciphertext or a reproducible extraction justified by K4; neither has been obtained.

Checkpoint at the end of the layered investigation: **K4-20261012-E**, with source and code hashes in the linked manifests. No Git revision exists. No K4/K5 solution, proof of impossibility, or novelty claim has been made.

## Language hypothesis refinement

The user proposed a non-English language using Latin letters. Exact constraints inB–E depend on the confirmed crib symbols and cipher models, not English frequency scoring; their exclusions remain valid under that proposal. The earlier assessment that eight completed strings do not read as coherent English is **not** an exclusion of every natural language or of an intermediate encoded layer. No multilingual classifier has been run, and none of the eight strings was discarded from the saved results.

A targeted primary-source check found Ed Scheidt's [21January2005 Wired interview](https://www.wired.com/2005/01/inside-info-on-kryptos-codes/), which explicitly describes all four sections as English and says the last hides recognizable language characteristics. He also acknowledges uncertainty over Sanborn's final changes. English final plaintext therefore has stronger documentary support than a wholly foreign-language K4 message, while a non-English key, codeword, or intermediate transformation remains a separate hypothesis. This statement about the original four sections must not be treated as evidence fixing K5's language. Further details are recorded in [language notes](../docs/LANGUAGE_NOTES.md).

Independent audit completion: all21,254 contradictions have valid certificates; all986 forest fits are structurally consistent for arbitrary edge labels; all32 cyclic fits passed separate elimination modulo2 and13, CRT reconstruction, crib checks, and full re-encryption. Thus all22,272 stored classifications have independent coverage within the stated model. This verifies the finite classification, not the sculpture's intended system.

## Current user route: interpretation after decryption

The user proposed EASTNORTHEAST→ENE and BERLINCLOCK→BC as an additional word-to-symbol stage, analogous to codewords. [SEMANTIC_LAYER.md](SEMANTIC_LAYER.md) records its exact scope, the difference between a conventional compass abbreviation and an unverified initialism, and its first discriminating checks. It preserves the original 97-letter plaintext and full 24-letter crib constraints before any shortening. This route remains open; the required codebook or consistent extraction rule has not been identified. The next checkpoint checks specific interpretations without searching arbitrary abbreviations.

## Checkpoint F: semantic interpretation and codeword constraints

The [primary-source review](../docs/SEMANTIC_SOURCES.md) visually verified Sanborn's two-page November 2025 letter. It explicitly identifies the World Clock, describes K5 as 97 characters with a similar coding system, and places the words BERLINCLOCK in the same position as K4. Interpreting this last statement as the same plaintext positions is natural but is an inference. No K5 ciphertext or ENE/BC conversion rule was supplied. The interviews support distinguishing a decoded message from its further meaning.

The [semantic audit](semantic_constraints.md), [saved results](runs/semantic-001/results.json), and [validated manifest](runs/semantic-001/manifest.json) give two exact results:

- Replacing only the two known phrases with ENE and BC leaves a 78-character mask, including 73 unknown letters. Taking initials under EAST|NORTHEAST instead gives EN and a 77-character mask. Neither result determines K5's length or recovers a message. A consistent segmentation or codebook must decide the operation.
- Treating ENE and BC as the two repeating additive keys is a separate hypothesis. All 174 stored models with key-length pairs (3,2) or (2,3), 29 fixed routes, and three layer orders have independently verified contradiction certificates. This excludes those keys within the shared-KRYPTOS-alphabet models, not abbreviations applied after decryption. The check reads old classifications and rederives their witnesses; it performs no new key search.

The recorded semantic run took under one second in one Python process. Pinned inputs and historical results remained unchanged. Application tests and heavy CPU/GPU work remain unperformed; the requested interruption of n5_runner has not been confirmed.

The [NATO codeword audit](semantic_audit.md) supplies another exact exclusion. ST in EASTNORTHEAST and NC in BERLINCLOCK occur neither within a standard NATO letter word nor across two such words joined together. Therefore the literal crib-bearing plaintext cannot consist entirely of the 26 NATO letter words, even with unknown boundaries. [Results](runs/nato-001/results.json) record all internal/boundary pairs, all 676 ordered word-pair checks, and two positive controls; the [manifest](runs/nato-001/manifest.json) passed validation. Custom codebooks, mixed prose/codewords, other alphabets, and a separate intermediate text remain open.

Checkpoint at the end of the semantic review: **K4-20261012-F**. No decipherment has been established. The open semantic route needs a rule justified independently of the desired output, with fixed word boundaries and a prediction beyond the two supplied phrases. A direction/location interpretation is also distinct from taking initials; the sources do not fix a geographic origin, distance, or text-reading route. The existing cipher exclusions continue to apply to their stated models regardless of any later interpretation.

## Checkpoint G: alphabet changes and broader substitution tables

Current checkpoint: **K4-20261012-G**, based on F with unchanged K4 input. [Full findings and evidence](LAYER_FINDINGS_G.md) record two new exact solvers and the source limits. No decipherment has been achieved.

- All 1,392 models using independently chosen standard/KRYPTOS alphabets, the 29 stored routes, three stage placements, and key-length pairs (3,2), (2,3), (10,8), (8,10) contradict the 24 cribs. This includes 696 mixed-alphabet models and 348 historical KRYPTOS/KRYPTOS regression checks. A separate implementation replayed all 78,086 rejected-root certificates and verified all component counts and accepted assignments.
- Removing the alphabet/cyclic-shift assumptions entirely leaves 348 arbitrary-table models. Repeated-phase equality alone rejects 172; transitive intermediate-letter equalities reject 189. The remaining 159 have constructible arbitrary substitution tables, not inferred Kryptos keys. An independent graph representation agreed on all classifications, and every constructed plaintext re-encrypts exactly. The component-label construction is complete here because there are only 24 crib equations and 26 alphabet symbols.
- Both bounded-run manifests passed validation. The formal reduction and non-affine hand controls received independent review. Small single-process computations ran; no full app test or large search ran, and n5_runner interruption remains unconfirmed.

Decision: do not rerun the selected standard/KRYPTOS alphabet models unchanged. The new broad checker can reject an independently justified new route or table family before a language search. Further work needs a specified new constraint or family, rather than an arbitrary completion. Other alphabets preserving cyclic-shift structure, key lengths, transpositions, padding/feedback, and interpretation after decryption remain open. K5 still awaits authenticated ciphertext or a justified extraction rule; no new input was obtained here.

## Checkpoint H: predictive coverage and scoring correction

Current checkpoint: **K4-20261012-H**. [Findings and prioritized improvements](IMPROVEMENTS_H.md) address the user's request for smarter approaches. No decipherment has been established.

- A scorer audit found that the prototype included known clue letters despite claiming to exclude them. All engine paths now mask those letters and every feature touching them, preserve gaps, and report scored coverage. Six tiny targeted regressions passed; the full app suite remains unrun. Earlier exact research exclusions are unaffected because they did not use this scorer.
- [Prediction results](runs/prediction-001/results.json) establish that 84 of the existing 1,018 shared-alphabet fits force all 73 unknown letters. The other 934 remain underdetermined. With either phrase withheld, 1,016 models force zero held letters and two force one; no model predicts an entire held phrase. This is retrospective coverage, not independent validation, since both phrases originally selected the models.
- [Complete-string inspection](runs/complete-predictions-001/results.json) groups the 84 complete predictions into 46 distinct strings and ranks only their unknown positions. None appeared to be coherent English on inspection; this is not an exclusion of other languages or intermediate encodings. Both new runner manifests passed validation. No new key/route search ran.

Next priority: demonstrate hidden-key/route recovery on controlled known-method examples, then compare the complete selection procedure against specified randomized controls. Follow with one new constrained model, such as unknown alphabets retaining cyclic structure or an independently justified transposition family. Multilingual scoring and fixed semantic extraction rules remain useful supporting routes. Do not treat additional crib fits as progress without a discrimination test. Heavy searches/full app tests remain deferred pending the requested interruption of `n5_runner`.
